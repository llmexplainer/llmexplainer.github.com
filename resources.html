          <p>It's important to understand what AI tools <i>can</i> do, but the question often remains: what <i>should</i> should they do? In <a href="https://drawtheline.db.mildlyupset.com/" target="_blank"><i>Draw the Line</i></a> by <a href="fredwordie.com">Fred Wordie</a>, reflect on and decide where you personally draw the line on what human tasks <i>should</i> be delegated to computers.

          <p>While AI technologies may seem to exist only on our mobile or computer devices, the underlying computational processes require physical space and resources. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2026/01/06/data-centers-backlash-impact-local-communities-opposition/" target="_blank">Data centers</a> that host computing hardware required to train AI often come with large financial and environmental costs, such as a large use of energy and land often felt by local communities where the centers are based. Beyond the facade of automation, post-training and finetuning of AI requires large-scale human labour, which can include the exploitation of workers around the world.</p>
